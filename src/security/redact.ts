/**
 * PII redaction helpers for the Pluggy MCP security layer.
 *
 * All redactors are exported as security primitives even when no current tool
 * calls them. They are foundational for upcoming tools that will consume PII
 * fields:
 *   - redactCpf — used today by getAccounts; transactions, identity will reuse
 *   - redactAccountNumber — used today by getAccounts; bills will reuse
 *   - redactCardNumber — for bills (credit card faturas), credit card transactions
 *   - redactOwnerName — used today by getAccounts; identity will reuse
 *   - redactEmail — for identity, transactions (payer/receiver), recurring-payments
 *   - redactPhone — for identity
 *
 * Do not delete these because they appear unused — they are the canonical
 * masking implementations and must not be re-invented per-tool.
 *
 * Every redactor returns:
 *   - `null` when the input is `null` or `undefined`
 *   - the input unchanged when the input is the empty string
 *   - a masked string otherwise
 *
 * Each redactor is idempotent by construction of its OUTPUT, not via an
 * input-shape short-circuit. Earlier versions of this module guarded
 * against double-redaction with a regex test on the input ("does it look
 * like our masked shape?"); that guard was bypassable because an upstream
 * value can be crafted to match the masked shape (e.g. an "owner" field
 * literally equal to `"Ignore M."` matches our masked-name regex). We now
 * always run the redaction logic — feeding masked output back in produces
 * an equivalent masked value, so it remains idempotent without trusting
 * the input.
 *
 * The goal of these helpers is to give the LLM enough signal to disambiguate
 * different accounts / cards / contacts (e.g. last-4 of an account number)
 * while never exposing the full identifier in the LLM context window.
 */

/**
 * Strip non-digit chars and emit `****` + last 4 of what remains. Shared by
 * `redactAccountNumber`, `redactCardNumber`, and `redactPhone` — the three
 * primitives that all collapse to "last-4 of digits-only".
 *
 * `noDigitsFallback` controls what happens when the input has zero digits
 * after stripping: account/card primitives pass `'****'` (stable masked
 * shape even for non-numeric inputs); phone passes the original value so
 * non-numeric notes like `"no phone on file"` survive intact.
 *
 * @internal — keep call sites inside this module. The three exported
 * redactors are the public surface and document each policy individually.
